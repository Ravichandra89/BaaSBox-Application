# BaaSBox - Backend as a Service Platform

## Objective

BaaSBox is a Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform designed to simplify backend infrastructure management for developers. By integrating AWS resources like authentication, database management, and deployment pipelines, BaaSBox aims to streamline backend operations, enhancing developer productivity and accelerating application development. I am going to create a platform similar to Vercel, where users can deploy their MERN websites on AWS with S3 support in one click by providing their GitHub repository link.

## Features

1. **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito integration
2. **Database Management**: Amazon DynamoDB and RDS
3. **Storage**: Amazon S3 integration
4. **Serverless Computing**: AWS Lambda
5. **CI/CD Pipelines**: AWS CodePipeline
6. **User Interface**: Intuitive backend management interface
7. **Monitoring & Logging**: Amazon CloudWatch

## Development Steps

1. Architecture Design
2. Backend Development
3. Frontend Development
4. Integration Testing
5. CI/CD Implementation
6. Deployment
7. Testing

## Technology Stack
